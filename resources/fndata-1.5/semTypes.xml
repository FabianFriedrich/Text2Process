An example is the Commerce frame, in which a Lexical Unit like commerce.n denotes an interaction between participants (Buyer, Seller, Money, and Goods) but profiles none of them.

With these adjectives, the verbal notion is incorporated in the meaning of the adjective.

The Support subtype of bound lexical unit is exemplified by give with a causal meaning:

Receiving the notification so late almost gave me a heart attack.

Give.v in the Causation frame is usable with a large number of dependents denoting the Effect, but not all:

Releasing these old files nearly gave a disaster.
