Welcome to Release 1.5 of the FrameNet data!

If you just want to start looking at the data, you should be able to 
open any of the index files, frameIndex.xml, luIndex.xml or
fulltextIndex.xml in Firefox or other popular browsers and browse
through it.  (If you have difficulty doing this, please see the
documentation on browser compatibility.)

Next, please read the documentation (in the /docs directory): General
Release notes will tell you about what is different in this release.
XMLDocumentation gives the details of the XML/XSL format, which is new
in this release.  "The Book" (formally "FrameNet II: Extended Theory
and Practice" as printed on September 14, 2010) gives a great deal
more detail of the theory behind FrameNet and the principles followed
in the annotation.

As always, the FrameNet project public website, at

http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu

contains much more information and more current news.  We plan a major
overhaul of the public website in the next few months, along with a
revision of the Book, parts of which are somewhat out of date. In the
meantime, please submit any questions to the forum pages on the public
website.  Note that in order to do so, you have to create a login for
yourself, which is separate from the login and password for
downloading the FN data.

Thank you for your interest in FrameNet.

Sincerely,

Collin F. Baker
