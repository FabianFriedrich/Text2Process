The first step is to determine contact details of potential customers. 
This can be achieved in several ways. 
Sometimes, we buy details for cold calls, sometimes, our marketing staff participates in exhibitions and sometimes,  you just happen to know somebody, who is interested in the product. 
Then we start calling the customer. 
That is done by the call center staff. 
They are determining the contact person and the budget which would be available for the project. 
Of course, asking the customer whether he is generally interested is also important. 
If this is not the case, we leave him alone, except if the potential project budget is huge. Then the head of development personally tries to acquire the customer. If the customer is interested in the end, the next step is a detailed online presentation. It is given either by a sales representative or by a pre-sales employee in case of a more technical presentation. Afterwards we are waiting for the customer to come back to us. If we are not contacted within 2 weeks, a sales representative is calling the customer. The last phase is the creation of a quotation.
