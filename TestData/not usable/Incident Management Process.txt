The shown incident management process of a software manufacturer is triggered by a customer requesting help from her account manager because of a problem in the purchased product. First of all, the account manager should try to handle that request on his own and explain the solution to the customer, if possible. If not, the account manager will hand over the issue to a 1st level support agent, who will hand over to 2nd level support, if necessary. The 2nd level support agent should figure out if the customer can fix the problem on her own, but if the agent is not sure about this he can also ask a software developer for his opinion. In any case, at the end the account manager will explain the solution to the customer.
