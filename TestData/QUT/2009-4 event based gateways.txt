In the context of a claim handling process, it is sometimes necessary to send a questionnaire to the
claimant to gather additional information. 
The claimant is expected to return the questionnaire within five days. 
If no response is received after five days, a reminder is sent to the claimant. 
If after another five days there is still no response, another reminder is sent and so on until the completed questionnaire is received.
