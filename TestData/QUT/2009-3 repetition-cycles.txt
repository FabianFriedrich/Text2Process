After a claim is registered, it is examined by a claims officer. The claims officer then writes a “settlement recommendation”. 
This recommendation is then checked by a senior claims officer who may mark the claim as “OK” or “Not OK”. 
If the claim is marked as “Not OK”, it is sent back to the claims officer and the recommendation is repeated.
If the claim is OK, the claim handling process proceeds.
