The party sends a warrant possession
request asking a warrant to be released.
The Client Service Back Office as part of the
Small Claims Registry Operations receives
the request and retrieves the SCT file. Then,
the SCT Warrant Possession is forwarded to
Queensland Police. The SCT physical file is
stored by the Back Office awaiting a report to
be sent by the Police. When the report is
received, the respective SCT file is retrieved.
Then, Back Office attaches the new SCT
document, and stores the expanded SCT
physical file. After that, some other MC
internal staff receives the physical SCT file
(out of scope).
