The Police Report related to the car accident is searched within
the Police Report database and put in a file together with the
Claim Documentation. This file serves as input to a claims
handler who calculates an initial claim estimate. Then, the claims
handler creates an Action Plan based on an Action Plan Checklist
available in the Document Management system. Based on the
Action Plan, a claims manager tries to negotiate a settlement on
the claim estimate. The claimant is informed of the outcome,
which ends the process.
