The process starts when a customer submits a claim by sending in relevant documentation. The Notification department at the car insurer checks the documents upon completeness and registers the claim. Then, the Handling department picks up the claim and checks the insurance. Then, an assessment is performed. If the assessment is positive, a garage is phoned to authorise the repairs and the payment is scheduled (in this order). Otherwise, the claim is rejected. In any case (whether the outcome is positive or negative), a letter is sent to the customer and the process is considered to be complete.
