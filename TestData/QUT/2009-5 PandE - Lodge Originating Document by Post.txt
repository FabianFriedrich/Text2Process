Mail from the party is collected on a daily basis by the Mail
Processing Unit. Within this unit, the Mail Clerk sorts the unopened
mail into the various business areas. The mail is then distributed.
When the mail is received by the Registry, it is opened and sorted
into groups for distribution, and thus registered in a manual
incoming Mail Register. Afterwards, the Assistant Registry Manager
within the Registry performs a quality check. If the mail is not
compliant, a list of requisition explaining the reason for rejection is
compiled and sent back to the party. Otherwise, the matter details
(types of action) are captured and provided to the Cashier, who
takes the applicable fees attached to the mail. At this point, the
Assistant Registry Manager puts the receipt and copied documents
into an envelope and posts it to the party. Meantime, the Cashier
captures the Party Details and prints the Physical Court File.
