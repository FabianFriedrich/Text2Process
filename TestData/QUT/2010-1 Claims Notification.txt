When a claim is received, it is first checked whether the claimant
is insured by the organization. If not, the claimant is informed that
the claim must be rejected. Otherwise, the severity of the claim is
evaluated. Based on the outcome (simple or complex claims),
relevant forms are sent to the claimant. Once the forms are
returned, they are checked for completeness. If the forms provide
all relevant details, the claim is registered in the Claims
Management system, which ends the Claims Notification process.
Otherwise, the claimant is informed to update the forms. Upon
reception of the updated forms, they are checked again.
