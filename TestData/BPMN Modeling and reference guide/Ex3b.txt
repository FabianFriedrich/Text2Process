Once the dates are finalized (by the
Coordination Unit), the Support Officer updates all group calendars and creates meeting
folders for each meeting and ensures all appropriate documents are uploaded to system.
Committee Members are advised a week before each meeting to read all related
documents. The Committee Members hold their meeting, and the Support Office then
produces minutes including any Action Points for each Committee Member. Within 5
working days, the Coordination Unit must conduct a QA check on the minutes, which are
then sent to all Committee Members. The Support Officer then updates all departmental
records.
