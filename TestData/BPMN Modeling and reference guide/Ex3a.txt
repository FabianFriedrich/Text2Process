In November of each year, the Coordination Unit at the Town Planning Authority drafts a
schedule of meetings for the next calendar year and adds draft dates to all calendars. The
Support Officer then checks the dates and suggests modifications. The Coordination Unit
then rechecks all dates and looks for potential conflicts. The final schedule of meeting dates
is sent to all the independent Committee Members by email, who then check their diaries
and advise the Coordination Unit of any conflicts.
