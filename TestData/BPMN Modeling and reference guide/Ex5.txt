After the Process starts, a Task is performed to locate and distribute any relevant existing
designs, both electrical and physical. Next, the design of the electrical and physical systems
starts in parallel. Any existing or previous Electrical and Physical Designs are inputs to both
Activities. Development of either design is interrupted by a successful update of the other
design. If interrupted, then all current work is stopped and that design must restart.
In each department (Electrical Design and Physical Design), any existing designs are
reviewed, resulting in an Update Plan for their respective designs (i.e. one in Electrical and
another in Physical). Using the Update Plan and the existing Draft of the Electrical/Physical
Design, a revised design is created. Once completed the revised design is tested. If the
design fails the test, then it is sent back to the first Activity (in the department) to review
and create a new Update Plan. If the design passes the test, then it tells the other
department that they need to restart their work.
When both of the designs have been revised, they are combined and tested. If the combined
design fails the test, then they are both sent back to the beginning to initiate another design
cycle. If the designs pass the test, then they are deemed complete and are then sent to the
manufacturing Process [a separate Process].
