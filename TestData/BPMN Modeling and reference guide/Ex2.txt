The Customer Service Representative sends a Mortgage offer to the customer and waits for
a reply. If the customer calls or writes back declining the mortgage, the case details are
updated and the work is then archived prior to cancellation. If the customer sends back the
completed offer documents and attaches all prerequisite documents then the case is moved
to administration for completion. If all pre-requisite documents are not provided a message
is generated to the customer requesting outstanding documents. If no answer is received
after 2 weeks, the case details are updated prior to archive and cancellation.
