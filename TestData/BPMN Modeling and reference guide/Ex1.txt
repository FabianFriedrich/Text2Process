Every weekday morning, the database is backed up and then it is checked to see whether
the “Account Defaulter” table has new records. If no new records are found, then the
process should check the CRM system to see whether new returns have been filed. If new
returns exist, then register all defaulting accounts and customers. If the defaulting client
codes have not been previously advised, produce another table of defaulting accounts and
send to account management. All of this must be completed by 2:30 pm, if it is not, then an
alert should be sent to the supervisor. Once the new defaulting account report has been
completed, check the CRM system to see whether new returns have been filed. If new
returns have been filed, reconcile with the existing account defaulters table. This must be
completed by 4:00 pm otherwise a supervisor should be sent a message.
