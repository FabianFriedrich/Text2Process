The intake workflow starts with a notice by telephone at the secretarial office of the mental
health care institute. This notice is done by the family doctor of somebody who is in need of
mental treatment. The secretarial worker inquires after the name and residence of the patient. On
the basis of this information, the doctor is put through to the nursing officer responsible for the
part of the region that the patient lives in.
The nursing officer makes a full inquiry into the mental, health, and social state of the patient
in question. This information is recorded on a registration form. At the end of the conversation,
this form is handed in at the secretarial office of the institute. Here, the information on the form
is stored in the information system and subsequently printed. For new patients, a patient file is
created. The registration form as well as the print from the information system are stored in the
patient file. 

At the secretarial office, two registration cards are produced for respectively the future first and second
intaker of the patient. 
The new patient is added on the list of new notices.
Halfway the week, at Wednesday, a staff meeting of the entire medical team takes place. 
At this meeting, the team-leader assigns all new patients on the list of new notices to members of the team. Each
patient will be assigned to a social-medical worker, who will act as the first intaker of the
patient. One of the physicians will act as the second intaker. 

The assignments are recorded on an assignment list which is handed to the secretarial office. For each new assignment, it is also determined whether the medical file of the patient is required. This information is added to the
assignment list.
The secretarial office stores the assignment of each patient of the assignment list in the
information system. It passes the produced registration cards to the first and second intaker of
each newly assigned patient. 

For each patient for which the medical file is required, the secretarial office prepares and sends a letter to the family doctor of the patient, requesting for a copy of the medical file. As soon as this copy is received, the
secretarial office will inform the second intaker and add the copy to the patient file.
The first intaker plans a meeting with the patient as soon as this is possible. During the first
meeting, the patient is examined using a standard checklist which is filled out. Additional
observations are registered in a personal notebook. After a visit, the first intaker puts a copy of
these notes in the file of a patient. The standard checklist is also added to the patient's file.
The second intaker plans the first meeting only after the medical information of the physician
– if required – has been received. Physicians use dictaphones to record their observations made
during meetings with patients. The secretarial office types out these tapes, after which the
information is added to the patient file.
As soon as the meetings of the first and second intaker with the patient have taken place, the
secretarial office puts the patient on the list of patients that reach this status. For the staff
meeting on Wednesday, they provide the team-leader with a list of these patients. For each of
these patients, the first and second intaker together with the team-leader and the attending
psychiatrist formulate a treatment plan. This treatment plan formally ends the intake procedure.
