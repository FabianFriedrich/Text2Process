#The following describes a Sales process. 

First, the Manager checks the open leads. Afterwards, he selects the top five ones. He then tells his Sales Assistant to call the contact person of the leads. The Sales Assistant calls each customer. If someone is interested, he sends a note to the Manager. The Manager then processes the lead. Otherwise, he calls the next customer.
